# LocalHackDayRadio
Local Hack Day Radio was a project that <a href="https://github.com/IranEG">IranEG</a> and I developed during Local Hack Day at FIU which won first place. The point of the project was to create a streaming site where local artists can upload their music based on the genres that were pre-selected. Users were able to stream music based on the genre they selected. The site was built with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and PHP
