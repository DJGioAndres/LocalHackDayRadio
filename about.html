    	<h3>Giovanni Andres</h3>
    	<p><strong>Information Technology</strong>, I love IT because I can totally relate it to real life. People are like computers, network is the relationship that people share and storage represents the memories of all the good things you've done in life!</p>
    	<h3>Nicholas Demello</h3>
    	<p><strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, The greatest inventors of the past were creative, intelligent thinkers who imagined solutions. This to me embodies engineering today. As a Computer engineer, I’m called upon to answer difficult technical problems that involve creating solutions that require innovation and invention. Engineers are modern-day inventors.</p>
    	<h3>Johnathan Escobar</h3>
    	<p><strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, As with the other answers here the best thing about Engineering for me is that you get to take the design, the theory, the physics and the maths and then use it to create something real which you can touch and hold. More often than not those products are beyond extraordinary and that’s what make engineering so exciting.</p>
    	<h3>Iran Garcia</h3>
    	<p><strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, Being that I’m not quite an engineer yet, I only know why I wish to become one. Simply stated, I want to be able to create and improve products that help society. What is living truly all about if we are not trying to make the world the best place it can be. Being an engineer will give me the opportunity to develop ways to help improve the life of others from a more intellual level.</p>
